# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will churn using machine learning classification models. It uses customer demographic and service usage data to identify churn patterns.

## Dataset
Telco Customer Churn dataset

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Methodology
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Categorical encoding
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation

## Results
Random Forest performed better in identifying churned customers.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies
2. Open the notebook and run all cells
